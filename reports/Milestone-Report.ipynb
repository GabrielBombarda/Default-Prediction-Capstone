This anonymized data set was used by Dr. I-Cheng Yeh in his 2009 paper \"The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients.\" [1]  The dataset has been made available to the public and posted on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website (See: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients). \n",
